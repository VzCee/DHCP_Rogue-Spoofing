# DHCP_Rogue-Spoofing
Academic project developed with Scapy to simulate a DHCP Rogue/Spoofing attack. It shows how a malicious DHCP server can respond before the legitimate one, assigning fake gateway and DNS settings to redirect client traffic through the attacker, enabling interception risks and highlighting the need for DHCP Snooping and proper network security.
